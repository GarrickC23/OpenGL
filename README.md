# OpenGL

Hello! This is just me playing around with OpenGL for fun. I started off simulating some basic rain and I'm looking to venture into other cool stuff like smoke and maybe even cloth.

## What's Inside

1. **Rain Simulation** - I was able to make a very basic rain simulation with gravity, random sizes, and different positions from where they are dropped. There's still some things I want to improve to make it more realistic like adding darkening to the ground or a wind element.
2. **Next Up** - I'm thinking of trying out smoke or mist next. Also, cloth simulation sounds exciting, so those are the goals in the coming months/years.
